📈 My Story: From Mechanical Ops to Strategic IT Leadership
My career began in mechanical systems and engineering operations, where I led multi-million-dollar equipment installations and created data-driven cost-saving strategies. But I knew I wanted more — more collaboration, more creativity, more impact.

That vision brought me to the world of business analysis and software. I’ve since helped organizations like 3M and Alcove Ridge LLC bridge the gap between business and tech, implementing Salesforce-based ERP solutions, creating custom asset tracking tools that saved millions, and delivering AI-powered insights that reshaped team efficiency.

From healthcare to cloud services, I’ve helped build the blueprint for transformation — one feature, sprint, and stakeholder at a time.
